==Readme for android-fling app==
I decided to name some of the functions differently because they are less of event
handlers and more of "do this to the object" functions. For example, I named it 
_resetLocation()_ instead of _onResetLocation()_.

Basically what needs to be done is:
* add images--almost done
* add fling and other gestures
* check if other tutorials have necessary info
