==Readme for android-fling app==
I decided to name some of the functions differently because they are less of event
handlers and more of "do this to the object" functions. For example, I named it 
''resetLocation()'' instead of ''onResetLocation()''.

===Still needs to be done===
* add images--almost done
* add fling and other gestures
* check if other tutorials have necessary info
